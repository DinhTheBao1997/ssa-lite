Project Idea – Lightweight JS UI Library for Legacy Enterprise Systems
This project was born from the need to modernize legacy JSP-based enterprise applications, where UI logic was tightly coupled with backend rendering. The goal was to extract and manage UI logic purely in JavaScript, making it easier to maintain, debug, and scale.

Key motivations:

JSP lacks modern development support (IDE autocompletion, debugging, browser tools).

Repetitive UI code (e.g., data tables) across screens led to high maintenance cost.

Existing enterprise systems had no consistent structure for frontend development.

Solution Highlights:

Developed a lightweight JavaScript framework with Angular-inspired architecture, including concepts like selector, htmlTemplate, elementRef, onInit, and onAfterViewInit.

Automatically instantiates JS UI classes based on predefined structure, allowing modular screen logic.

Created a config-driven table generator: by providing a JSON config, the system renders a full-featured data table with enterprise-specific behavior (editing cells, formatting, etc.), replacing repeated jQuery datatable implementations.

Reduced the need to embed JavaScript in JSP, improving maintainability and reducing code duplication.

Focused on SPA-like behavior without requiring a full SPA framework – lightweight, flexible, and easy to integrate into server-rendered systems.
